My name is Riccardo Chirra. I live in Switzerland, near to the Italian border. I was involved in countless projects as a software developer, scrum master, and product owner. Founder of Triman GmbH in Lucerne in year 2000. Since 2017 I lead a team of developers for a swiss company located in Berne, GARAIO AG. They are simply different.

The passion for beautiful code has never vanished.
